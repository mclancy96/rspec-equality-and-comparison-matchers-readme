# RSpec: Equality & Comparison Matchers

Welcome to Lesson 12! In this lesson, you'll learn about RSpec's equality and comparison matchers: `eq`, `eql`, `equal`, and the comparison matchers `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`. We'll break down what each matcher does, when to use them, and how to avoid common pitfalls. As always, you'll see file path comments, code block language annotations, and plenty of examples.

_Recall from previous lessons: All of these matchers are used with `expect` to set up your test's expectations._

## Equality Matchers: eq, eql, equal

```ruby
# /spec/equality_spec.rb
RSpec.describe 'Recipe and RecipeRating equality and comparison matchers' do
  let(:recipe1) { Recipe.new('Pancakes', RecipeRating.new(5, 'Alice')) }
  let(:recipe2) { Recipe.new('Waffles', RecipeRating.new(4, 'Bob')) }
  let(:rating_a) { RecipeRating.new(5, 'Alice') }
  let(:rating_b) { RecipeRating.new(5, 'Alice') }
  let(:rating_c) { RecipeRating.new(5, 'Bob') }
  let(:rating_d) { RecipeRating.new(4, 'Alice') }

  describe 'eq matcher' do
    it 'checks value equality for numbers' do
      expect(recipe1.rating.value).to eq(5)
    end

    it 'checks value equality for RecipeRating objects' do
      expect(rating_a).to eq(rating_b)
    end
  end

  describe 'eql matcher' do
    it 'checks value and type for numbers' do
      expect(5).to eql(5)
      expect(5).not_to eql(5.0)
    end

    it 'checks value and reviewer for RecipeRating' do
      expect(rating_a).to eql(rating_b)
      expect(rating_a).not_to eql(rating_c)
    end
  end

  describe 'equal matcher' do
    it 'checks object identity for RecipeRating' do
      expect(rating_a).not_to equal(rating_b)
      expect(rating_a).to equal(rating_a)
    end

    it 'checks object identity for strings' do
      a = 'hello'
      b = 'hello'
      expect(a).not_to equal(b)
      expect(a).to eq(b)
    end
  end
```

**Sample Output (passing):**

```shell
Equality Matchers
  demonstrates eq matcher
  demonstrates eql matcher (same type)
  demonstrates eql matcher (different type)
  demonstrates eq vs eql edge case
  demonstrates equal matcher

Finished in 0.01 seconds (files took 0.1 seconds to load)
5 examples, 0 failures
```

**Sample Output (failing):**

```shell
Failure/Error: expect(2).not_to eql(2.0)

  expected: value != 2.0
       got: 2
       (compared using eql?)
```

## Comparison Matchers: >, <, >=, <=

Comparison matchers let you check numeric relationships directly. These use the actual comparison operators, not equality (`==`).

  describe 'comparison matchers' do
    it 'checks greater than for rating values' do
      expect(recipe1.rating.value).to be > recipe2.rating.value
    end

    it 'checks less than or equal to for rating values' do
      expect(recipe2.rating.value).to be <= recipe1.rating.value
    end

    it 'checks less than for rating values' do
      expect(recipe2.rating.value).to be < recipe1.rating.value
    end

    it 'checks greater than or equal to for rating values' do
      expect(recipe1.rating.value).to be >= recipe2.rating.value
    end
  end

  describe 'pending specs for students' do
    it 'is pending: test that two Recipe objects with same name and rating are eq but not equal' do
      pending("Student: Write a spec for eq vs equal on Recipe objects")
      raise "Unimplemented pending spec"
    end

    it 'is pending: test that a RecipeRating with higher value is greater than another' do
      pending("Student: Write a spec for > on RecipeRating objects")
      raise "Unimplemented pending spec"
    end
  end
end

```

**Sample Output (passing):**

```shell
Comparison Matchers
  checks greater than
  checks less than or equal to
  checks less than
  checks greater than or equal to

Finished in 0.01 seconds (files took 0.1 seconds to load)
4 examples, 0 failures
```

## Common Pitfalls

- `eq` checks value equality (`==`), not object identity.
- `eql` checks value and type.
- `equal` checks object identity (`.equal?`).
- Use comparison matchers for numeric comparisons, not `eq`â€”`eq` can pass for numbers of different types (e.g., 2 and 2.0), but `eql` will not.

## Getting Hands-On: Student Instructions

This lesson repo is set up for you to get hands-on practice with RSpec's equality and comparison matchers using a real-world recipe domain (Recipe/RecipeRating).

**To get started:**

1. **Fork and Clone** this repository to your own GitHub account and local machine.
2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
      bundle install
    ```

3. **Run the specs:**

    ```sh
      bin/rspec
    ```

4. **Explore the code:**

    - The main domain code is in `lib/recipe_rating.rb`.
    - The robust example specs are in `spec/equality_spec.rb`.

5. **Implement the pending specs:**

    - There are at least two pending specs marked with `pending` in `spec/equality_spec.rb`.
    - Your task: Remove the `pending` line and implement the expectation so the spec passes.

6. **Experiment:**

    - Try adding your own examples using `eq`, `eql`, `equal`, and comparison matchers.
    - Make the specs fail on purpose to see the error messages and learn from them.

All specs should pass except the pending ones. When you finish, all specs should be green!
